> 2021-06-30: Not yet compatible with **DSM 7** since the package architecture has changed and the build process needs to be changed. Working on it!

A minimal Synology package for [AirConnect](https://github.com/philippe44/AirConnect).  
It allows you to use [AirPlay](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AirPlay) to stream to **UPnP/Sonos** & **Chromecast** devices that do not natively support AirPlay.

## Information

Since the [original repository](https://github.com/bandesz/AirConnect-Synology) from [@bandesz](https://github.com/bandesz) was archived, I will try to provide the latest (and new) releases here regularly.  

- Updated the installation scripts to make them more robust to certain problems and also fixed a few bugs.
  - Also changed the build process and installation scripts with more validation and error handling.
- Adapted the documentation (this readme for now) to make it easier for new users to get started and to make everything a bit more understandable.
- Added new releases to fit the current AirConnect versions.
  - AirConnect-Synology releases will use the official AirConnect version + the current build date as tag/version (f.e. `0.2.25.0-20200511`)
- Added new pre-build synology packages that includes all current supported architectures and platforms
  - New pre-build: `ppc, ppc-static, arm, arm-static, armv8-static/aarch64-static`
  - Updated `armv7, armv8, x86` and `x86-64` to also support the newer (and older) synology hardware
  - Check [Download the pre-built Synology package](#download-the-pre-built-synology-package) for more information.  

I own multiple Synology NAS devices and the current Synology Router, as long as that is the case, I will also update the releases regularly.  
If a release is missing or does not work on your device, please open an [issue](https://github.com/eizedev/AirConnect-Synology/issues), then I will check this and deliver it to.

The credit goes of course still to [@bandesz](https://github.com/bandesz) for the initial work and [philippe44](https://github.com/philippe44) for the AirConnect application.  

## How to install

Every pre-build synology package in the [releases](https://github.com/eizedev/AirConnect-Synology/releases) section are including these two programs:

- `airupnp`
  - For **UPnP/Sonos players**
- `aircast`
  - For **Chromecast**

So you only need one package to support **UPnP**, **Sonos** and **Chromcast** devices.

### Download the pre-build Synology package

You can find the available packages under [releases](https://github.com/eizedev/AirConnect-Synology/releases) for the follow different architecture groups.

The minimum firmware version for the x86_64 package `AirConnect-x86-64-${VERSION}` is **DSM 6.0-7321**. For **all** other package the minimum firmware version is DSM **5.0-4458**.

If the `x86` (32-bit) package is not working on your device, please download the `x86-64` (64-bit) package instead.

You can check which architecture you have in the `Package Arch` column on the Synology [What kind of CPU does my Synology NAS have?](https://www.synology.com/en-us/knowledgebase/DSM/tutorial/Compatibility_Peripherals/What_kind_of_CPU_does_my_NAS_have) site. Please **find your device** in the overview on the **synology site** and compare the `Package Arch` column on the synology site with the `Architecture` column in the table above.

> If the above **ARMv7** package will not work on your device, please download the latest `arm-static` package. The static package includes "static" binaries, that means, it includes binaries that have no external library dependencies and **should** be run on your ARMv7 device if the normal ARMv7 package fails.

> If the above **PowerPC** package will not work on your device, please download the latest `ppc-static` package. The static package includes "static" binaries, that means, it includes binaries that have no external library dependencies and **should** be run on your PPC device if the normal PPC package fails.

For the Synology **Routers** you should use the **ARM** (ARMv7 - dakota, ipq806x, northstarplus) version. If the normal ARM package is not working on your device, please try **ARM Static** instead.

### Install via GUI (Package Center)

- Open the Package Center app.
- As this package is not an official Synology package you may have to
  - **Allow packages from any publisher**
    - Go to **Settings** and set the **Trust Level** to "**Any publisher**".
- Click on **Manual Install** and upload the package you just downloaded.

Don't forget to **change back** the **Trust level** to "Synology Inc." for additional security.

You can view the logs by clicking on **View Log** on the packages page, or, if not available on your device, by using the [command line](#install-via-command-line).  

### Install via command line

- Connect to your NAS/Router via ssh ([How to login to DSM with root permission via SSH/Telnet](https://www.synology.com/en-global/knowledgebase/DSM/tutorial/General_Setup/How_to_login_to_DSM_with_root_permission_via_SSH_Telnet))
- Copy over or download your release for [your architecture](#download-the-pre-built-synology-package)
  - For example, you can use (S)FTP to copy your files to your NAS ([How to access files on Synology NAS via FTP
](https://www.synology.com/en-global/knowledgebase/DSM/tutorial/File_Sharing/How_to_access_files_on_Synology_NAS_via_FTP)).
  - You can also copy your files to a shared folder (f.e. `home` -> `/volume1/home`) on your NAS and, after connecting via ssh, change to the shared folder directory.
- Change the path to the directory where you copied the package file (f.e. `home` -> `cd /volume1/home`).
- Run the following command based on your architecture and version `sudo synopkg install AirConnect-${ARCH}-${VERSION}.spk`
  - Example: `sudo synopkg install AirConnect-arm-0.2.24.7-20200417.spk`
- Start the **AirConnect** package with `sudo /usr/syno/bin/synopkg start AirConnect` or trough the Package Center
- Check the status of AirConnect with `sudo /usr/syno/bin/synopkg status AirConnect`
- The default installation directory is located here: `/var/packages/AirConnect/`
  - The binaries can be found in: `/var/packages/AirConnect/target/`

You could also clone this repository on your synology device and build your package for your architecture locally, check [Build](#build) for more details.

#### Logfiles

- **Synology Service Log File**
  - The *synology dsm package logfile* ist located at `/var/log/packages/AirConnect.log`
  - This logfile is used from DSM/Synology for all installation/uninstallation/update purposes  
- **AirConnect-Synology and AirConnect Log File**
  - The *AirConnect application logfile* is located at `/var/log/airconnect.log` (default location)
  - You can open it after login with ssh to your NAS/Router: `sudo /usr/syno/bin/synopkg log AirConnect` or by using a command line utility like `more` (`more /var/log/airconnect`) `tail` (`tail -100 /var/log/airconnect`) etc. 
  - This log file is written by the AirConnect synology package. All log entries of the AirConnect application (airupnp + aircast) are also written into this log file.
  - This is the first place to look for errors.

## How it works

It runs the AirConnect processes with the following options by default tuned for sonos:

```bash
/volume1/@appstore/AirConnect/airupnp -b [synology device local ip]:49154 -l 1000:2000 -x "/volume1/@appstore/AirConnect/config.xml" -o "<NULL>,S1,S3,S5,S9,S12,ZP80,ZP90,S15,ZP100,ZP120,1.0,LibreWireless" -z -f "/var/log/airconnect.log" -d all=info  
/volume1/@appstore/AirConnect/aircast -b [synology device local ip] -l 1000:2000 -x "/volume1/@appstore/AirConnect/config-cast.xml" -z -f "/var/log/airconnect.log" -d all=info
```

### Supported UPnP Speakers

To speed up the detection of Sonos/UPnP/DLNA speakers and to do not discover speakers which natively supports airplay, this synology package will only include the devices mentioned in the table below.

> If you have another UPnP based speaker that you want to be supported by this package which is not in the list below, please open an [issue](https://github.com/eizedev/AirConnect-Synology/issues) and let me know (Please tell me the product name (**model name**, **model number** etc.))

>With `-o <NULL>,S1,S3,S5,S9,S12,ZP80,ZP90,S15,ZP100,ZP120,1.0,LibreWireless` the sonos/UPnP speakers that are natively supporting AirPlay or AirPlay2 will be ignored from AirConnect/airupnp and only the ones listed with `-o` will be used. Since no new "non airplay" speakers (from sonos) will be released in the future, that should work in any case. So they will be not displayed twice in the list.  

#### List of supported UPnP Speakers

| Model Number  | Friendly Name                       | Comment (Sonos seriesid, etc.) |
| ------------- | ----------------------------------- | ------------------------------ |

| LibreWireless | LibreWireless based Speakers        | LibreSyncDMR                   |
| `<NULL>`      | All speakers without a model number |                                |

See [Command-Line Arguemts](#command-line-arguemts) for more information about these arguments.

These default options should work for most of you but can also be changed by using a [configuration file](#configuration).

Both processes are running with the low-privilege user `airconnect`.

The processes will only recognise your devices if they are bound to the appropriate local network IP, but this is not trivial as there are various Synology devices and network setups out there.  
The start script will check all your local network interfaces for private ip addresses (Ranges: `192.168.*` or `10.*` or `172.16.* - 172.31.*` or `17.0.64.* - 17.0.127.*`).

>The startup check if new speakers were discovered is currently disabled due to a bug:

~~After startup of airupnp/aircast the processes will check if any device (Sonos/UPnP/Chromcast) was discovered (based on some log entries).  
It there are no devices added in the first **10 seconds** after startup, it will try the next interface (if more interfaces are available).  
For the automatic IP discovery to work you should have at least **one UPnP/Sonos/Chromecast** device that is online in your local network.  
If no device was discovered, the processes will be stopped automatically.~~

If the start script is not able to find the right IP automatically you can fix it in `scripts/start-stop-status` by setting your own local IP (of your nas/router) and building your own package.

Look for the following lines:

```bash
# If you want to start the airconnect processes on a specific IP please uncomment the following lines
# and set your own local IP address:
#
# start_airconnect_on_ip "1.2.3.4" || true
# return  0
```

Alternatively you can open an [issue](https://github.com/eizedev/AirConnect-Synology/issues) and include your network interface list and your local IP and i will extend the default network interfaces filter with your list.

### Configuration

If you would like to tweak the AirConnect configuration you can also use the AirConnect configuration file.
> Before continuing please check the [official readme](https://github.com/philippe44/AirConnect#config-file-parameters) for more information. I'm not going to explain how it generally works here.

### Config File

By default the config file will **not** being used as long as the file is not created (And you are not running on debug log level). The file is **not** created by default.  

- Config File location for airupnp
  - `/volume1/@appstore/AirConnect/config.xml`
- Config File location for aircast
  - `/volume1/@appstore/AirConnect/config-cast.xml`

You can create each of these files manually or a reference version can be generated using the `-i [config file name]` command line parameter.
For the following example i am using the default configuration you can find above in the [How it works](#how-it-works) section. I am just change the `-x` parameter with the `-i` parameter.

Change the ip and parameters for your needs:

Example:

```bash
/volume1/@appstore/AirConnect/airupnp -b 192.168.1.249:49154 -l 1000:2000 -i "/volume1/@appstore/AirConnect/config.xml" -o "S1,S3,S5,S9,S12,ZP80,ZP90,S15,ZP100,ZP120" -z -f "/var/log/airconnect.log" -d all info -d main=info
```

After running this command, airupnp will be started until all needed information and devices are gathered, stopped and the resulted configuration will be written to the defined config file.

> Please check the original [Player specific hints and tips](https://github.com/philippe44/AirConnect#player-specific-hints-and-tips) from [philippe44](https://github.com/philippe44) for more information.

#### Sonos

The upnp version is often used with Sonos players. When a Sonos group is created, only the master of that group will appear as an AirPlay player and others will be removed if they were already detected. If the group is later split, then individual players will re-appear.

You need to use the Sonos native application for grouping / ungrouping.

When changing volume of a group, each player's volume is changed trying to respect the relative values. It's not perfect and still under test now. To reset all volumes to the same value, simply move the cursor to 0 and then to the new value. All players will have the same volume then. You need to use the Sonos application to change individual volumes.

To identify your Sonos players, pick an identified IP address, and visit the Sonos status page in your browser, like `http://192.168.1.126:1400/support/review`. Click `Zone Players` and you will see the identifiers for your players in the `UUID` column.

#### Bose SoundTouch

[@chpusch](https://github.com/chpusch) has found that Bose SoundTouch work well including synchronisation (as for Sonos, you need to use Bose's native application for grouping / ungrouping). I don't have a SoundTouch system so I cannot do the level of slave/master detection I did for Sonos

#### Pioneer/Phorus/Play-Fi

Check the [Configuration](#configuration) section on how to apply the below tuning to the configuration.

Some of these speakers only support mp3 and require a modified `ProtocolInfo` to stream correctly. This can be done by editing the [config file](#configuration) and changing `<codec>flac</codec>` to `<codec>mp3</codec>` and replacing the `<mp3>..</mp3>` line with:

```html
<mp3>http-get:*:audio/mpeg:DLNA.ORG_PN=MP3;DLNA.ORG_OP=00;DLNA.ORG_CI=0;DLNA.ORG_FLAGS=0d500000000000000000000000000000</mp3>
```

## Build

You need to install the following packages on your distribution:

- make
- shellcheck

After that you can start the build process by running `shellcheck` or directly with the build steps.

### Run shellcheck (optional)

```bash
make shellcheck
```

### Build packages for all architectures

```bash
make clean build-all
```

### Build a package for a specific architecture

```bash
ARCH=arm make clean build
```

Possible values for **ARCH**: `arm, aarch64, arm5, ppc, ppc-static, x86, x86-64`

You can find the built packages in the **dist** directory.

## Troubleshooting

### Cannot be installed

If you get an error message that the package **cannot be installed** or **updated** when updating AirConnect-Synology, please **uninstall the old version** first (`Package Center -> AirConnect -> Uninstall`) and then install the new version. Uninstalling also removes the old scripts, references and configurations (only the logfile remains). Sometimes it can happen that the problem is already fixed with this.  

### Issues

If you have a problem installing or using one of these packages and/or are stuck, please open an [issue](https://github.com/eizedev/AirConnect-Synology/issues).  
It would be very helpful for me if you tell me the synology device you are using, the package you have downloaded and upload the two logfiles mentioned in the [Logfiles](#logfiles) section or include the important parts from the logfiles in the issue.

If the package was installed successfully and `airupnp` and `aircast` are running and no strange problems will be shown in the logfile but for you it is not working as excpeted, please consider opening an [issue](https://github.com/philippe44/AirConnect/issues) at the officiall AirConnect Repository.

### Multicast and IGMP Snooping/Proxy

Most of the problems with AirConnect are related to the local network configuration.
AirConnect (and therefore Sonos/Chromecast) require **Multicast** to function properly. You must ensure that the communication within your network supports multicast. Especially important is the communication:

> Chromecast/Sonos speakers <-> (WLAN)-Router <-> (Switch/Firewall <->) Smartphone which is used

So make sure that multicast is allowed on your router, your switches and your firewall and configure settings like IGMP snooping + IGMP proxy so that the communication is guaranteed. For testing, please deactive igmp snooping everywhere if you have activated it.  
I have activated but properly configured igmp snooping and igmp proxy + different VLANs. It will work with AirConnect, if properly configured.

- When players disappear regularly, it might be that your router is filtering out multicast packets. For example and testing, for a Asus AC-RT68U, you have to login by ssh and run `echo 0 > /sys/class/net/br0/bridge/multicast_snooping` but it does not stay after a reboot.
- Lots of users seems to have problems with Unify and broadcasting / finding players. Here is a guide https://www.neilgrogan.com/ubnt-sonos/ made by somebody who fixes the issue for his Sonos environment

### Debugging

If you want to see more logs then change the `-d all=info` parameter in `scripts/start-stop-status` to `-d all=debug` and rebuild the package, then [install it again](#install-via-command-line).
